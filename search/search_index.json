Instant Funds (Real-Time Data)\nWhen you look at your Available Balance on the Cash Positioning dashboard, that number is fetched directly from QBank's core system the moment you refresh the page.\nEndpoint Used: This relies on the QBank Connect /balances endpoint.\nBest For: Making immediate decisions, such as confirming funds for a large wire transfer or ensuring a check won't cause an overdraft. This data is the most current and can be refreshed multiple times per hour.\n\n### 2. Reconciliation and Auditing (Batch-Latent Data)\nThe detailed Transaction History visible below the balance is used for daily reconciliation, auditing, and reporting.\nEndpoint Used: This relies on the QBank Connect /transactions endpoint.\nData Latency: Since transactional records (like checks cleared or ACH debits) are processed through the bank's end-of-day batch processing, the history you view is updated only once per day, typically after 1:00 am (the nightly cutoff).\nBest For: Month-end closing, regulatory reporting, and confirming past activity.\n\n## The Core Concept: Data Cutoff\nThe most important thing to remember is the daily data cutoff. Any transactions that occur today (for instance, an ACH payment initiated this morning) will not appear in your detailed Transaction History until tomorrow morning after the nightly data synchronization. The only way to see today's impact is through the Available Balance figure.\n\n---\n\n# alternative content\n\n# \ud83d\udcb0 Real-Time Cash Positioning: A Core TreasuryPro Concept\n\nReal-Time Cash Positioning is the capability to view your company\u2019s global cash balances and transactions as they occur, providing an immediate, accurate snapshot of liquidity. This is fundamental to **TreasuryPro's** value proposition, allowing treasury professionals to make informed decisions about funding and investment quickly.\n\n---\n\n## Why Real-Time Data Matters\n\nTraditional cash positioning relies on end-of-day bank files, which creates a significant time delay (a cash blind spot). Real-Time Cash Positioning eliminates this lag by integrating directly with QBank and other financial institutions via the **QBank Connect API**.\n\n| Old Method (End-of-Day) | TreasuryPro Real-Time Positioning |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Data Latency:** 12-24 hours | **Data Latency:** Seconds |\n| **Decision Impact:** Reactive | **Decision Impact:** Proactive |\n| **Risk:** Increased overdraft/idle cash risk | **Risk:** Optimized liquidity management |\n\n## Key Components\n\nThe system relies on three core components working together:\n\n1.  **QBank Connect:** Our primary API integration layer that ingests transaction feeds directly from QBank as they are processed.\n2.  **Intraday Ledger:** A continuously updated ledger that aggregates and normalizes real-time data from all connected accounts.\n3.  **Liquidity Forecast Engine:** Uses the real-time data to generate precise, hourly liquidity forecasts, allowing for immediate action.\n\nBy understanding the real-time cash position, users gain the ability to **maximize investment returns** and **minimize borrowing costs** with unparalleled speed.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Reference/treasurypro_release_notes/","title":"TreasuryPro Release Notes","text":""},{"location":"Reference/treasurypro_release_notes/#november-20-2025-version-220","title":"November 20, 2025: Version 2.2.0","text":"<p>This update introduces major enhancements to the Cash Management module, improving efficiency and data accuracy.</p>"},{"location":"Reference/treasurypro_release_notes/#whats-new","title":"What's New","text":""},{"location":"Reference/treasurypro_release_notes/#real-time-status-indicators","title":"Real-Time Status Indicators","text":"<p>We have added a new status indicator to the Payment Submission screen.

Locate Account: Use the search bar or filters (e.g., by Account Name or Account Number) to find the specific account you wish to review.\n2. View Balance Panel: Click on the account name. A dedicated panel will load, displaying the following figures:\n    - Available Balance: This is the real-time amount you have available to spend today. This figure reflects all pending debits and credits that have cleared, as well as any holds.\n    - Ledger Balance: This is the technical balance that reflects transactions as of the last nightly cutoff (e.g., yesterday's closing balance).\n\n## Step 3: Refresh the Data\nTo ensure the Available Balance is the most current number, you must manually trigger a fetch request from the bank.\n1. Locate Refresh Button: Find the Refresh button (often represented by a circular arrow icon ) located near the Available Balance figure.\n2. Click Refresh: Click the button. The system will send an immediate call to the QBank Connect /balances endpoint.\n3. Confirm Timestamp: Once the data is updated, a timestamp will confirm the last successful data retrieval (e.g., \"Last Updated: Today at 1:25 PM\").\n\n---\n\n# Alternative Content\n\n# \ud83d\udd0d How to Check Your Intraday Available Balance\n\nThis guide explains how to view your real-time available cash balance across all integrated bank accounts using the TreasuryPro dashboard.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* You must have **Viewer** or **Controller** permissions for the Cash Management module.\n* Your accounts must be connected to **QBank Connect** for real-time feed updates.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Access the Dashboard\n\n1.  Log into your TreasuryPro application.\n2.  From the primary navigation menu on the left, select the **Cash Management** icon (often represented by a piggy bank or money icon).\n3.  The **Cash Overview Dashboard** will load, displaying summary widgets for all accounts.\n\n## Step 2: Locate the Available Balance Widget\n\n1.  Scroll down to the section labeled **Intraday Liquidity Position**.\n2.  The top metric in this section is **Total Available Balance**. This figure is updated every 60 seconds based on the latest transactions received via QBank Connect.\n\n## Step 3: View Account-Specific Details\n\n1.  To drill down into a specific account, click the **View Details** button located in the bottom-right corner of the **Intraday Liquidity Position** widget.\n2.  A table will expand, showing line-by-line data for each bank account. The most important columns are:\n    * **Booked Balance:** The balance as of the last End-of-Day report.\n    * **Pending Adjustments:** Total value of transactions confirmed but not yet settled.\n    * **Intraday Available Balance:** (Booked Balance + Pending Adjustments). This is your true real-time usable cash.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf the **Intraday Available Balance** is not updating, please verify your **QBank Connect** status under the System Settings menu.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Tasks/03_reconcile_transaction_history/","title":"Reconcile Transaction History","text":"<pre><code>How to Reconcile Transaction History (Batch-Latent Data)\nThis guide explains how to use the detailed transaction history for daily auditing and reconciliation. Remember that this data is Batch-Latent, meaning it updates once per day.\nStep 1: Access the Transaction History Report\nFrom the Real-Time Cash Positioning dashboard:\nSelect the Account: Click on the account you wish to reconcile.\nView History: Navigate to the \"Detailed Transaction History\" tab, which displays transactions dating back to the start of the previous business day.\nStep 2: Use the Posting Date Filter\nFor accurate, auditable daily reconciliation, it is critical to filter the report using the Posting Date field, not the transaction date.\nLocate Filters: Find the date range or filtering options above the transaction list.\nApply Posting Date: Set the filter to search by Posting Date and select the previous business day's date.\nReason: The Posting Date reflects the date the transaction record was synchronized by the QBank Connect mETL engine (after 1:00 am). By filtering on yesterday's Posting Date, you ensure you are viewing only fully reconciled and final records.\nRun Report: Click \"Apply\" or \"Run Report\" to refresh the list with synchronized data.\nStep 3: Compare Balances and History\nThe goal of reconciliation is to match the transaction history received via the API to your internal ERP records and verify the figures against the bank's final Ledger Balance.\nVerify Opening Balance: Ensure the Ledger Balance from the prior day matches your ERP's closing cash position for that date.\nMatch Transactions: Cross-reference the individual transaction entries from the QBank Connect report with the transactions logged in your ERP system.\nUse Date Fields: If there are discrepancies, use the three date fields provided by QBank Connect (transaction_date, value_date, and posting_date) to clarify timing, as explained in the Architecture Overview. The posting_date is the final authority for synchronized records.\nConfirm Closure: Once all entries for the previous day are matched, your daily cash position is considered fully reconciled and ready for internal accounting closure.\n\n---\n\n# Alternative Content\n\n# \ud83d\udd04 How to Reconcile Transaction History (Batch-Latent Data)\n\nWhile TreasuryPro provides real-time cash positioning, regulatory compliance and auditing require reconciliation against final, batch-processed bank statements (End-of-Day or EOD data). This guide shows you how to use batch-latent data for reconciliation.\n\n## Understanding Batch-Latent Data\n\nBatch-latent data refers to transaction records received in large, scheduled data dumps (e.g., MT940 files). This data is typically considered the *official* record for accounting purposes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Generate the Reconciliation Report\n\n1.  Navigate to the **Reports** module in the main TreasuryPro navigation.\n2.  Select **GL Reconciliation** from the report category menu.\n3.  Set the following parameters:\n    * **Date Range:** Select the month or quarter you wish to reconcile.\n    * **Data Source:** Select **EOD Statement Data** (ensuring you are not using the Intraday Feed).\n4.  Click **Generate Report**.\n\n## Step 2: Compare and Flag Discrepancies\n\n1.  The report will display two main columns: **Booked Balance** (from EOD files) and **Intraday Final Balance** (from the QBank Connect feed).\n2.  Any row where the balances differ by more than $0.01 is automatically flagged in red.\n3.  Click the **Flag as Discrepancy** button next to the row to open a ticket in your internal tracking system for further investigation by the operations team.\n\n&gt; **Note:** The majority of discrepancies are caused by transactions that were initiated intraday but settled on the following business day.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Tutorials/01_user_profile_setup/","title":"Setting Up Your TreasuryPro User Profile","text":"<p>This tutorial guides first-time users through the necessary steps to configure their security settings, set notification preferences, and complete their profile for optimal use of TreasuryPro.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/01_user_profile_setup/#step-1-initialize-your-profile-security","title":"Step 1: Initialize Your Profile Security","text":"<ol> <li>Navigate to Settings &gt; User Profile.</li> <li>Set your initial Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) device (e.g., Google Authenticator).
