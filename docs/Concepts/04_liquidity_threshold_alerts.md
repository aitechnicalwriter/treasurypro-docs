# 🔔 Liquidity Threshold Alerts

Liquidity Threshold Alerts notify you **automatically** when your real-time available cash balance falls below a user-defined minimum level.

If a large, unexpected transaction clears, or if expected funding is delayed, the system triggers an immediate notification, preventing:

* **Overdrafts:** Avoids costly overdraft fees and regulatory penalties.
* **Funding Gaps:** Ensures you have time to initiate a short-term borrowing request or move funds from another account.

## Alert Customization

You can customize alerts based on:

* **Account:** Specific alerts for primary operating accounts or pooled accounts.
* **Threshold Value:** Define the exact dollar amount (e.g., \$150,000.00).
* **Delivery Channel:** Receive alerts via email, SMS, or dashboard notification.
