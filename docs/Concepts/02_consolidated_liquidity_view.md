# 📊 Consolidated Liquidity Dashboard

The Consolidated Liquidity Dashboard aggregates all cash balances and transactions into a single, unified view, eliminating the need to log into multiple banking portals.

## How it Works

The view is built on continuous, real-time data feeds powered by the **QBank Connect API**.

1.  **Normalization:** Data received from various banks (each with different formats like BAI2) is automatically normalized into a single, standardized data structure.
2.  **Aggregation:** All account balances (checking, savings, money market) are summed up and presented as the **Total Available Cash Position**.
3.  **Visualization:** Key metrics are presented visually on the dashboard (e.g., historical trends, projections, and account summaries).
