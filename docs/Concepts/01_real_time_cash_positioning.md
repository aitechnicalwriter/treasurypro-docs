# Real-Time Cash Positioning

Real-Time Cash Positioning is the capability to view your company’s global cash balances and transactions as they occur, providing an immediate, accurate snapshot of liquidity. 

With **TreasuryPro**, you can make informed decisions about funding and investment.

## Real-Time Data Matters

Traditional cash positioning relies on end-of-day bank files, which creates a significant time delay (a cash blind spot). Real-Time Cash Positioning eliminates this lag by integrating directly with QBank via the **QBank Connect API**.

| Old Method (End-of-Day) | TreasuryPro Real-Time Positioning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Latency:** 12-24 hours | **Data Latency:** Seconds |
| **Decision Impact:** Reactive | **Decision Impact:** Proactive |
| **Risk:** Increased overdraft/idle cash risk | **Risk:** Optimized liquidity management |

## Core Components

The TreasuryPro system relies on three core components working together:

1.  **QBank Connect:** Our primary API integration layer that ingests transaction feeds directly from QBank as they are processed.
2.  **Intraday Ledger:** A continuously updated ledger that aggregates and normalizes real-time data from all connected accounts.
3.  **Liquidity Forecast Engine:** Uses the real-time data to generate precise, hourly liquidity forecasts, allowing for immediate action.

By understanding the real-time cash position, users gain the ability to **maximize investment returns** and **minimize borrowing costs** with unparalleled speed.
