New QBank Connect Features (October 2025)
Audience: Users of the ERP Platform (e.g., Treasury, Accounts Payable, Accounting Teams)
We are excited to announce two major upgrades to your cash management features, powered by our partner, QBank Connect. These updates provide faster fund access and simpler auditing.

1. ⚡ New Payment Speed: Instant Transfers (Real-Time Payments)
You now have access to Real-Time Payments (RTP), a new payment option for urgent and high-value transfers.
What’s New for You?
Instant Confirmation: When you submit a payment using the new Instant Transfer option, you receive immediate, guaranteed confirmation within seconds. This removes any uncertainty about whether the funds were successfully sent.
24/7/365 Availability: Instant Transfers can be initiated and settled at any time, including nights, weekends, and holidays.
Irreversible Guarantee: Once you receive the "Posted Success" status in your ERP, the payment is guaranteed to be settled in the recipient's account.
Where to Find It?
Look for the new "Instant Transfer (RTP)" option in the payment method dropdown when initiating a high-priority transfer or wire payment.
Tip: Use Instant Transfer when you need to confirm a large payment has landed immediately, such as closing a last-minute deal or covering an urgent liability.

2. 📂 Automated Statement Image Retrieval
You no longer need to manually log into a separate QBank portal to download and file your monthly bank statements. Your ERP platform can now retrieve official statement PDFs automatically.
What’s New for You?
One-Click Auditing: The new Statement Archive feature in your ERP provides a direct link to the official, monthly PDF statement image from QBank.
Simpler Reconciliation: Easily access historical statements for audit trails without leaving your ERP environment.
Faster Access: Statements are available immediately after the bank finalizes the month-end process.
Where to Find It?
Navigate to the Reporting or Document Archive module in your ERP. You will find a new section titled "Bank Statement Images" where you can select the month and account to retrieve the PDF.
