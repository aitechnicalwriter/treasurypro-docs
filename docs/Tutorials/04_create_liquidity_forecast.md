# 📈 Creating a Basic Liquidity Forecast

This tutorial demonstrates how to leverage real-time and historical data within TreasuryPro to generate a forward-looking cash flow projection.

## Step 1: Launch the Forecast Module
1. From the **Cash Management** dashboard, click **Forecast Tools**.
2. Select **New Hourly Forecast**.

## Step 2: Set Inputs and Assumptions
1. **Starting Balance:** This automatically pulls your current **Intraday Available Balance**.
2. **Select Accounts:** Check the boxes next to the QBank accounts you wish to include.
3. **Input Known Payables:** Manually enter the expected amount and time for any payments scheduled outside of TreasuryPro.
    * Example: Enter a $50,000 withdrawal for 3:00 PM EST.

## Step 3: Review and Save
1. The system generates a graph showing the projected cash line over the next 24 hours.
2. Click **Save and Subscribe** to receive an alert if the forecast projects a negative balance at any point.
