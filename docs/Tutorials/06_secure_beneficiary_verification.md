# Performing Secure Beneficiary Verification

Before making a payment, all new beneficiaries must undergo secure verification to prevent fraud.

## Step 1: Initiate Beneficiary Creation
1. Go to **Payments** > **Beneficiary List**.
2. Click **+ Add New Beneficiary**.
3. Enter the payee's name, address, and bank routing details.

## Step 2: Complete Two-Factor Authorization
1. The system prompts you for a **Secondary Verification Code**.
2. Open your 2FA app and enter the six-digit code. This protects the integrity of your beneficiary list.

## Step 3: Micro-Deposit Verification (New Payees Only)
1. TreasuryPro initiates two small, random micro-deposits (less than $1.00) to the new beneficiary's account.
2. After 24 hours, return to the **Beneficiary List**, click the beneficiary's name, and enter the two deposit amounts to confirm account ownership.
